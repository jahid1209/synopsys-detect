# Choosing the working directory

You can run [solution_name] from any directory. If you are not running [solution_name] from the project directory,
provide the project directory using the [source path property](../../properties/configuration/paths.md#source-path). When that property is not set,
[solution_name] assumes the current working directory is the project directory.
