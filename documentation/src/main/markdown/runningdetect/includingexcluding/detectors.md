# Detectors

By default, all detectors are eligible to run.  The set of detectors that actually
run depends on the files existing in your project directory.
To limit the eligible detectors to a given list, use:

````
--detect.included.detector.types={comma-separated list of detector names}
````

To exclude specific detectors, use:

````
--detect.excluded.detector.types={comma-separated list of detector names}
````

Exclusions take precedence over inclusions.

Refer to [Detectors](../../components/detectors.md) for the list of detector names.

Refer to [Properties](../../properties/all-properties.md) for details.
