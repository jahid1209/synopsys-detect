- In which directory do you want to run [solution_name]?
- Do you want to run [solution_name] as a script or a .jar file; this affects which version is run.
- What [tools and detectors](../../components/overview.md) do you want to include or exclude?
- Do you want to run [solution_name] offline, or connected to [blackduck_product_name].
